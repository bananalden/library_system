# Mini Capstone: Library Management System
This is the 2nd project in collaboration with Mark Joseph with it being a little more rushed due to time constraints. The front-end web design was done by Mark Joseph with all the backend code being written by me.

## How to set up
This project only served to be used for a school project only and so never reached public use. This section will highlight how to set it up for local development.

1. Install XAMPP and place project folder inside htdocs
2. Inside the *backend* folder, change the parameters for the database.php like the $db_server, $db_user, $db_pass, and $db_name to set up the connection to the database.
3. Open the MySQL and XAMPP server in order to launch to the local host.
